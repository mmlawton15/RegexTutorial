# challenge-seventeen-periwinkle
Repository for our 17th challenge of bootcamp. We are tasked with creating a tutorial that explains how a particular type of function breaks down parts of the expression and describing what it does.

## What is this?
This is my Regex, or Regular Expression tutorial. I took an example of a regex expression that checks emails to make sure they are valid, broke it down letter by letter, and explained what each piece of the expression means. Regex looks like a highly versatile tool, and I can tell why it would need a tutorial because different combinations of the same characters could mean many different things.

## How did I make it?
I created this by researching Regex and all of it's different components first. I then created a markdown file with a table of contents to organize my thoughts. Finally I went character by character to break down what comprised this expression and explain how/why it works to the user.

## Stack?
Backend:
- Regex

## Where can it be found?
This can be found at my github repo (https://github.com/mmlawton15/challenge-seventeen-periwinkle)
